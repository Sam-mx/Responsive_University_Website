              point for all students living with one or more disabilities,

              requests for assessment arrangements and reasonable adjustments.
            </h6>
            <h6 class="p-3">
              The main purpose of the Accessibility Service is to enable
              students' participation in their learning and coursework.
              Reasonable adjustments aim to minimise the impacts of
              disability/health conditions upon study as far as possible, whilst
              maintaining academic integrity.

              While the main focus remains on student's course progression, the

            <h6 class="p-3">
              Updating your accessibility details on My Student Admin (MSA)
              helps to ensure UTS is providing accurate data to the government.
              The funding model is based upon the number of students who share
              their accessibility information on MSA, rather than the number of
              students who are registered with the Accessibility Service (a
              student may wish to share their accessibility details on MSA but
              decide not to register with the Service, or vice versa). The data
              collected on MSA is the mechanism the government uses to determine
              the number of students with a disability across universities.
