            <h3>Finger-shaped sensor enables more dexterous robots</h3>
            <p>

            <img src="./assets/img/news1.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Imagine grasping a heavy object, like a pipe wrench, with one
              hand. You would likely grab the wrench using your entire fingers,
              not just your fingertips. Sensory receptors in your skin, which
              run along the entire length of each finger, would send information
              to your brain about the tool you are grasping.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a robotic hand, tactile sensors that use cameras to obtain
              information about grasped objects are small and flat, so they are
              often located in the fingertips. These robots, in turn, use only
              their fingertips to grasp objects, typically with a pinching
              motion. This limits the manipulation tasks they can perform.
            </p>

            <p>
              MIT researchers have developed a camera-based touch sensor that is
              long, curved, and shaped like a human finger. Their device
              provides high-resolution tactile sensing over a large area. The
              sensor, called the GelSight Svelte, uses two mirrors to reflect
              and refract light so that one camera, located in the base of the
              sensor, can see along the entire finger's length. The work has
              been published on the pre-print server arXiv.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the researchers built the finger-shaped sensor with a
              flexible backbone. By measuring how the backbone bends when the
              finger touches an object, they can estimate the force being placed
              on the sensor.
            </p>
            <p>
              They used GelSight Svelte sensors to produce a robotic hand that
              was able to grasp a heavy object like a human would, using the
              entire sensing area of all three of its fingers. The hand could
              also perform the same pinch grasps common to traditional robotic
              grippers.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Because our new sensor is human finger-shaped, we can use it to
              do different types of grasps for different tasks, instead of using
              pinch grasps for everything. There's only so much you can do with
              a parallel jaw gripper. Our sensor really opens up some new
              possibilities on different manipulation tasks we could do with
              robots," says Alan (Jialiang) Zhao, a mechanical engineering
              graduate student and lead author of a paper on GelSight Svelte.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zhao wrote the paper with senior author Edward Adelson, the John
              and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Vision Science in the Department
              of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and a member of the Computer
              Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The
              research will be presented at the IEEE Conference on Intelligent
              Robots and Systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cameras used in tactile sensors are limited by their size, the
              focal distance of their lenses, and their viewing angles.
              Therefore, these tactile sensors tend to be small and flat, which
              confines them to a robot's fingertips.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a longer sensing area, one that more closely resembles a
              human finger, the camera would need to sit farther from the
              sensing surface to see the entire area. This is particularly
              challenging due to size and shape restrictions of a robotic
              gripper.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zhao and Adelson solved this problem using two mirrors that
              reflect and refract light toward a single camera located at the
              base of the finger.
            </p>
            <p>
              GelSight Svelte incorporates one flat, angled mirror that sits
              across from the camera and one long, curved mirror that sits along
              the back of the sensor. These mirrors redistribute light rays from
              the camera in such a way that the camera can see the along the
              entire finger's length.
            </p>
            <p>
              To optimize the shape, angle, and curvature of the mirrors, the
              researchers designed software to simulate reflection and
              refraction of light.
            </p>
            <p>
              "With this software, we can easily play around with where the
              mirrors are located and how they are curved to get a sense of how
              well the image will look after we actually make the sensor," Zhao
              explains.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mirrors, camera, and two sets of LEDs for illumination are
              attached to a plastic backbone and encased in a flexible skin made
              from silicone gel. The camera views the back of the skin from the
              inside; based on the deformation, it can see where contact occurs
              and measure the geometry of the object's contact surface.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the red and green LED arrays give a sense of how
              deeply the gel is being pressed down when an object is grasped,
              due to the saturation of color at different locations on the
              sensor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The researchers can use this color saturation information to
              reconstruct a 3D depth image of the object being grasped.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sensor's plastic backbone enables it to determine
              proprioceptive information, such as the twisting torques applied
              to the finger. The backbone bends and flexes when an object is
              grasped. The researchers use machine learning to estimate how much
              force is being applied to the sensor, based on these backbone
              deformations.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, combining these elements into a working sensor was no
              easy task, Zhao says.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Making sure you have the correct curvature for the mirror to
              match what we have in simulation is pretty challenging. Plus, I
              realized there are some kinds of superglue that inhibit the curing
              of silicon. It took a lot of experiments to make a sensor that
              actually works," he adds.

              This gif shows a robotic hand that incorporates three,
              finger-shaped GelSight Svelte sensors. The sensors, which provide
              high-resolution tactile sensing over a large area, enable the hand
              to perform multiple grasps, including pinch grasps that use only
              the fingertips and a power grasp that uses the entire sensing area
              of all three fingers. Credit: Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology
            </p>
            <h4>Versatile grasping</h4>
            <p>
              Once they had perfected the design, the researchers tested the
              GelSight Svelte by pressing objects, like a screw, to different
              locations on the sensor to check image clarity and see how well it
              could determine the shape of the object.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also used three sensors to build a GelSight Svelte hand that
              can perform multiple grasps, including a pinch grasp, lateral
              pinch grasp, and a power grasp that uses the entire sensing area
              of the three fingers. Most robotic hands, which are shaped like
              parallel jaw drippers, can only perform pinch grasps.
            </p>
            <p>
              A three-finger power grasp enables a robotic hand to hold a
              heavier object more stably. However, pinch grasps are still useful
              when an object is very small. Being able to perform both types of
              grasps with one hand would give a robot more versatility, he says.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving forward, the researchers plan to enhance the GelSight
              Svelte so the sensor is articulated and can bend at the joints,
              more like a human finger.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Optical-tactile finger sensors allow robots to use inexpensive
              cameras to collect high-resolution images of surface contact, and
              by observing the deformation of a flexible surface the robot
              estimates the contact shape and forces applied. This work
              represents an advancement on the GelSight finger design, with
              improvements in full-finger coverage and the ability to
              approximate bending deflection torques using image differences and
              machine learning," says Monroe Kennedy III, assistant professor of
              mechanical engineering at Stanford University, who was not
              involved with this research.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Improving a robot's sense of touch to approach human ability is a
              necessity and perhaps the catalyst problem for developing robots
              capable of working on complex, dexterous tasks."

              By focusing on causal relationships in genome regulation, a new AI
              method could help scientists identify new immunotherapy techniques
              or regenerative therapies.

            <p>
              A strategy for cellular reprogramming involves using targeted
              genetic interventions to engineer a cell into a new state. The
              technique holds great promise in immunotherapy, for instance,
              where researchers could reprogram a patient’s T-cells so they are
              more potent cancer killers. Someday, the approach could also help
              identify life-saving cancer treatments or regenerative therapies
              that repair disease-ravaged organs.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the human body has about 20,000 genes, and a genetic
              perturbation could be on a combination of genes or on any of the
              over 1,000 transcription factors that regulate the genes. Because
              the search space is vast and genetic experiments are costly,
              scientists often struggle to find the ideal perturbation for their
              particular application.
            </p>
            <p>
              Researchers from MIT and Harvard University developed a new,
              computational approach that can efficiently identify optimal
              genetic perturbations based on a much smaller number of
              experiments than traditional methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their algorithmic technique leverages the cause-and-effect
              relationship between factors in a complex system, such as genome
              regulation, to prioritize the best intervention in each round of
              sequential experiments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The researchers conducted a rigorous theoretical analysis to
              determine that their technique did, indeed, identify optimal
              interventions. With that theoretical framework in place, they
              applied the algorithms to real biological data designed to mimic a
              cellular reprogramming experiment. Their algorithms were the most
              efficient and effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Too often, large-scale experiments are designed empirically. A
              careful causal framework for sequential experimentation may allow
              identifying optimal interventions with fewer trials, thereby
              reducing experimental costs,” says co-senior author Caroline
              Uhler, a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
              Computer Science (EECS) who is also co-director of the Eric and
              Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,
              and a researcher at MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision

            <h4>Active learning</h4>
            <p>
              When scientists try to design an effective intervention for a
              complex system, like in cellular reprogramming, they often perform
              experiments sequentially. Such settings are ideally suited for the
              use of a machine-learning approach called active learning. Data
              samples are collected and used to learn a model of the system that
              incorporates the knowledge gathered so far. From this model, an
              acquisition function is designed — an equation that evaluates all
              potential interventions and picks the best one to test in the next
              trial.
            </p>
            <p>
              This process is repeated until an optimal intervention is
              identified (or resources to fund subsequent experiments run out).
            </p>
            <p>
              “While there are several generic acquisition functions to
              sequentially design experiments, these are not effective for
              problems of such complexity, leading to very slow convergence,”
              Sapsis explains.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acquisition functions typically consider correlation between
              factors, such as which genes are co-expressed. But focusing only
              on correlation ignores the regulatory relationships or causal
              structure of the system. For instance, a genetic intervention can
              only affect the expression of downstream genes, but a
              correlation-based approach would not be able to distinguish
              between genes that are upstream or downstream.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You can learn some of this causal knowledge from the data and use
              that to design an intervention more efficiently,” Zhang explains.
            </p>
            <p>
              The MIT and Harvard researchers leveraged this underlying causal
              structure for their technique. First, they carefully constructed
              an algorithm so it can only learn models of the system that
              account for causal relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then the researchers designed the acquisition function so it
              automatically evaluates interventions using information on these
              causal relationships. They crafted this function so it prioritizes
              the most informative interventions, meaning those most likely to
              lead to the optimal intervention in subsequent experiments.
            </p>
            <p>
              “By considering causal models instead of correlation-based models,
              we can already rule out certain interventions. Then, whenever you
              get new data, you can learn a more accurate causal model and
              thereby further shrink the space of interventions,” Uhler
              explains.
            </p>
            <p>
              This smaller search space, coupled with the acquisition function’s
              special focus on the most informative interventions, is what makes
              their approach so efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              The researchers further improved their acquisition function using
              a technique known as output weighting, inspired by the study of
              extreme events in complex systems. This method carefully
              emphasizes interventions that are likely to be closer to the
              optimal intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Essentially, we view an optimal intervention as an ‘extreme
              event’ within the space of all possible, suboptimal interventions
              and use some of the ideas we have developed for these problems,”
              Sapsis says.
            </p>
            <h4>Enhanced efficiency</h4>
            <p>
              They tested their algorithms using real biological data in a
              simulated cellular reprogramming experiment. For this test, they
              sought a genetic perturbation that would result in a desired shift
              in average gene expression. Their acquisition functions
              consistently identified better interventions than baseline methods
              through every step in the multi-stage experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
              “If you cut the experiment off at any stage, ours would still be
              more efficient than the baselines. This means you could run fewer
              experiments and get the same or better results,” Zhang says.
            </p>
            <p>
              The researchers are currently working with experimentalists to
              apply their technique toward cellular reprogramming in the lab.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their approach could also be applied to problems outside genomics,
              such as identifying optimal prices for consumer products or
              enabling optimal feedback control in fluid mechanics applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the future, they plan to enhance their technique for
              optimizations beyond those that seek to match a desired mean. In
              addition, their method assumes that scientists already understand
              the causal relationships in their system, but future work could
              explore how to use AI to learn that information, as well.

            <p><span>by Korea Institute of Science and Technology</span></p>

            <p>
              Utilizing soft, flexible materials such as cloth, paper, and
              silicone, soft robotic grippers act like a robot's hand to perform
              functions such as safely grasping and releasing objects. Unlike
              conventional rigid material grippers, they are more flexible and
              safe, and are being researched for household robots that handle
              fragile objects such as eggs, or for logistics robots that need to
              carry various types of objects. However, its low load capacity
              makes it difficult to lift heavy objects, and its poor grasping
              stability makes it easy to lose the object even under mild
              external impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Song, Kahye of the Intelligent Robotics Research Center at the
              Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), along
              with Professor Lee, Dae-Young of the Department of Aerospace
              Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and
              Technology (KAIST), have jointly developed a soft gripper with a
              woven structure that can grip objects weighing more than 100 kg
              with 130 grams of material.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results of the study were published on August 2 in
              <i>Nature Communications</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To increase the loading capacity of the soft robot gripper, the
              research team applied a new structure inspired by textiles, as
              opposed to the conventional method of developing new materials or
              reinforcing the structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              The weaving technique they focused on involves tightly
              intertwining individual threads to create a strong fabric, which
              can reliably support heavy objects and has been used for centuries
              in clothing, bags, and industrial textiles. The team used thin PET
              plastic. The grippers were designed to allow the strips to
              intertwine and unwind into a woven structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              The resulting woven gripper weighs 130 grams and can grip an
              object weighing 100 kilograms. Conventional grippers of the same
              weight can lift no more than 20 kilograms at most, and considering
              that a gripper that can lift the same weight weighs 100 kilograms,
              the team succeeded in increasing the load capacity relative to its
              own weight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, the soft robot gripper developed by the research team uses
              plastic, which costs only a few thousand won (approx. $2) per unit
              of material, and can be used as a universal gripper that can grip
              objects of various shapes and weights, making it highly
              competitive in price. In addition, since the soft robot gripper
              can be manufactured by simply fastening a plastic strip, the
              manufacturing process can be completed in less than 10 minutes,
              and it is easy to replace and maintain, so the process efficiency
              is excellent.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to PET, which is the main material used by the
              research team, the gripper can also be made of various materials
              such as rubber and compounds that possess elasticity, allowing the
              team to customize and utilize grippers suitable for industrial and
              logistics sites that require strong gripping performance or
              various environments that need to withstand extreme conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The woven structure gripper developed by KIST and KAIST has the
              strengths of a soft robot but can grasp heavy objects at the level
              of a rigid gripper," said Dr. Song. "It can be manufactured in a
              variety of sizes, from coins to cars, and can grip objects of
              various shapes and weights, from thin cards to flowers, so it is
              expected to be used in fields such as industry, logistics, and
              housework that require soft grippers."

            <h3>7 Rules to Follow for a Successful Internship</h3>
            <p>
              Internships are such an important part of the college experience,
              as these work opportunities not only help you gain more
              experience, develop specific skills, and network with others in
              your field, but they also can open the door to other work
              opportunities after you graduate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ensuring that you have a successful internship doesn’t require a
              lot of overthinking or overworking. Here are seven rules to follow
              to help you make the most of your internship!
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/img/news4.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              <b>1. Learn About the Company:</b> To stand out to your boss and
              coworkers, research as much as you can about the company before
              you start your internship. Conducting research doesn’t have to be
              difficult, and can be accomplished by a simple Google search. Find
              the company website and note down all the important information
              that you can draw from it, such as the company mission statement,
              its intended target audience, its history, employee reviews, etc.
              When you research the ins and outs like this, it makes all the
              difference, as it shows your employer that you are serious about
              the position you have and the people/company you work for.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>2. Meet and Network With Your Coworkers:</b> In any workplace,
              having a solid network of connections is not only a meaningful way
              to make your internship more positive and pleasant, but it is also
              a means to help you find new work opportunities and potential
              promotions in the future. Professional social media pages, like
              Linkedin, are a great place to start, as you can connect with
              people you work with, or people that have similar backgrounds,
              interests, job positions, etc. as you. Whether it’s your coworkers
              or people you network with online, these mutual connections can
              point you in the direction of new contacts, job opportunities,
              etc. Plus, the bigger your network is, the more people you’ll have
              in your corner to vouch for you when it comes time for references!
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>3. Have a Goal in Mind:</b> Arguably the most important element
              when interning with a company is figuring out exactly what you
              want to accomplish as you go through the process. You may want to
              network with people in that field, develop interpersonal skills,
              master a technical skill, or simply get college credits.
              Regardless of what goals you have, an important part of the
              process is reflecting and searching within yourself to really find
              what motivates and inspires you in your internship, and go after
              what fulfills those goals in a meaningful way. Additionally, this
              part of the process will give you a clear idea of how to ask for
              what you want in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>4. Ask Questions:</b> Part of what can make your internship a
              success or a failure is your ability to ask questions. It may
              sound like an odd tip, but your ability to be vulnerable with your
              boss and ask questions about anything you may misunderstand, be
              confused about, or simply want to learn more about, can ultimately
              help you grow as a person and an employee. Your boss will
              definitely appreciate the effort you put forth by asking
              questions, and see that you are constantly trying to learn. This
              will be another skill or trait that will look better on your
              resume!
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>5. Manage Your Time Well:</b> Time management is something that
              can be utilized in just about every aspect of life, whether it’s
              at your job, in school, or in your personal life. With an
              internship, it’s important to manage your time well while you’re
              on and off the job. Make a schedule that combines elements of
              school and your internship, and fill it with dude dates for school
              projects, study time, and extracurriculars, as well as your job
              hours, deadlines for work projects, office meeting dates, and
              more. When you manage your time well, it shows your boss and
              coworkers that you can balance multiple things at once, and are a
              well-rounded employee.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>6. Always Be Professional:</b> In any setting and under any
              circumstance, professionalism is of the utmost importance. Whether
              your boss is giving you a lecture or extra work that you don’t
              want, always conduct yourself in a manner that is mature, calm,
              professional, and reasonable. Sticking through the good and bad
              parts of your internship will give you wisdom and brownie points
              for a future job.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>7. Seek Feedback:</b> Your manager, supervisor, etc. is your
              first point of contact and resource for everything involving your
              internship position. If you want to know what it will take to get
              from your current position to the one you want after your
              internship is finished, your supervisors are the best people to
              ask, as they can give feedback to help you improve in areas of
              weakness and build the skills that are necessary to advance.
              Kindly ask for feedback from your boss by presenting them with any
              and all accomplishments, experience, responsibilities, awards,
              etc. that you’ve obtained on the job. This will paint you in the
              most honest picture and give them an opportunity to give you a
              truthful perspective regarding your chances of getting your future
              dream job.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pressure to have a successful internship is real, but if you
              follow these steps, you will undoubtedly make new connections,
              gain new experience, and secure your dream job in the future.

            <p>
              Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis and the knee
              is the most common joint affected. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis,
              which is an inflammatory disease, osteoarthritis is due to the
              wear and tear of time. The bones of your knee joint are covered
              with a tough and smooth protective layer of cartilage and the
              joint is filled with a lubricating fluid. That allows your knee to
              move while you walk and run without damaging the ends of the
              bones.
            </p>
            <p>
              By age 70, <b>for about 40 percent of people,</b> the knee joint
              cartilage has started to thin or wear away. Bones are grinding on
              bones, the joint space gets narrower, and symptoms of pain and
              stiffness start to be a problem. There is no cure for
              osteoarthritis and it tends to gets worse over time, but there are
              some <b>effective treatments.</b> For about 10 percent of people
              with knee osteoarthritis, <b>knee injections</b> are part of the
              treatment.
            </p>
            <h4>
              American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Treatment
              Guidelines
            </h4>
            <p>
              According to the AAOS, the first treatments for osteoarthritis
              should include physical therapy and home exercise, nonsteroidal
              anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), weight loss if needed, and
              low-impact aerobic exercise. These treatments are called
              non-invasive treatments because they do not involve any injections
              or surgery. They can be managed with your primary care doctor.
              Non-invasive treatments can’t reverse damage done by
              osteoarthritis or prevent damage from getting worse, but they can
              slow down the disease and relieve symptoms. For many people, this
              is enough to make the disease manageable.
            </p>
            <p>
              NSAIDs can include both over-the-counter medications like Advil or
              Motrin, and prescription strength NSAIDs from your doctor.
              Physical therapy may include exercise, heat or cold applications,
              as well as massage or low-voltage transcutaneous electrical nerve
              stimulation (TENS) to reduce pain. Low-impact exercises reduce
              joint stress and can include swimming or walking.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is not much evidence to support alternative treatments. Some
              studies suggest a role for acupuncture to reduce pain. There is
              less support for joint supplements like glucosamine and
              chondroitin. Although many people seem to get relief, studies
              suggest this is probably a placebo effect. Omega-3 fatty acids in
              fatty fish or fish oil supplements have better evidence than other
              supplements for relief of pain and improving function.
            </p>
            <h4>The Role of Knee Injections</h4>
            <p>
              Knee injections are invasive therapies, usually given by an
              orthopedic specialist. According to
              <b>two 2022 studies</b> presented at the annual meeting of
              Radiological Society of North America; people who had steroid knee
              injections had more progression of osteoarthritis on knee imaging
              studies than people who had no injections.
              <b>Steroid knee injections</b> were also associated with more
              progression than knee injections using a substance called
              hyaluronic acid. Steroids work by decreasing swelling in the knee,
              so they do relieve pain and improve movement. Hyaluronic acid is a
              lubricant that may help protect the remaining cartilage in the
              joint.
            </p>
            <p>
              These new studies do not prove that steroid injections make knee
              osteoarthritis worse, and they are not the first studies to
              suggest that steroids may be linked to worse long-term outcomes.
              It may be that the patients who get steroid injections just have
              worse arthritis. According to AAOS guidelines, steroid injections
              are reserved for people who have significant changes on their knee
              x-rays, severe pain, and have not responded to non-invasive
              treatments.
            </p>
            <p>
              AAOS guidelines say steroids should be used for severe pain and
              inflammation because most studies show that these injections
              reliably relieve pain and swelling. AAOS does not recommend
              hyaluronic acid as a first treatment for severe osteoarthritis
              because the research does not support it. AAOS also says steroid
              injections should be limited to three or four times per year to
              reduce the risk of worsening joint damage over time.
            </p>
            <h4>The Role of Knee Surgery</h4>
            <p>
              Knee replacement surgery is recommended when all other treatments
              are not helping. Advances in <b>knee replacement surgery </b>have
              made it one of the fastest growing surgical options, even in
              people under age 60. The main reason is that replacing the knee
              with a meatal and plastic joint takes the pain away and returns
              basic function. In the hands of an experienced orthopedic surgeon,
              these results benefits are very reliable, and can last from 15 to
              25 years.

            <h3>AI copilot enhances human precision for safer aviation</h3>
            <p>
              Designed to ensure safer skies, “Air-Guardian” blends human
              intuition with machine precision, creating a more symbiotic
              relationship between pilot and aircraft.

            <img src="./assets/img/news6.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              Imagine you're in an airplane with two pilots, one human and one
              computer. Both have their “hands” on the controllers, but they're
              always looking out for different things. If they're both paying
              attention to the same thing, the human gets to steer. But if the
              human gets distracted or misses something, the computer quickly
              takes over.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meet the Air-Guardian, a system developed by researchers at the
              MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
              (CSAIL). As modern pilots grapple with an onslaught of information
              from multiple monitors, especially during critical moments,
              Air-Guardian acts as a proactive copilot; a partnership between
              human and machine, rooted in understanding attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              But how does it determine attention, exactly? For humans, it uses
              eye-tracking, and for the neural system, it relies on something
              called "saliency maps," which pinpoint where attention is
              directed. The maps serve as visual guides highlighting key regions
              within an image, aiding in grasping and deciphering the behavior
              of intricate algorithms. Air-Guardian identifies early signs of
              potential risks through these attention markers, instead of only
              intervening during safety breaches like traditional autopilot
              systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The broader implications of this system reach beyond aviation.
              Similar cooperative control mechanisms could one day be used in
              cars, drones, and a wider spectrum of robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
              "An exciting feature of our method is its differentiability," says
              MIT CSAIL postdoc Lianhao Yin, a lead author on a new paper about
              Air-Guardian. "Our cooperative layer and the entire end-to-end
              process can be trained. We specifically chose the causal
              continuous-depth neural network model because of its dynamic
              features in mapping attention. Another unique aspect is
              adaptability. The Air-Guardian system isn't rigid; it can be
              adjusted based on the situation's demands, ensuring a balanced
              partnership between human and machine."
            </p>
            <p>
              In field tests, both the pilot and the system made decisions based
              on the same raw images when navigating to the target waypoint.
              Air-Guardian’s success was gauged based on the cumulative rewards
              earned during flight and shorter path to the waypoint. The
              guardian reduced the risk level of flights and increased the
              success rate of navigating to target points.
            </p>
            <p>
              "This system represents the innovative approach of human-centric
              AI-enabled aviation," adds Ramin Hasani, MIT CSAIL research
              affiliate and inventor of liquid neural networks. "Our use of
              liquid neural networks provides a dynamic, adaptive approach,
              ensuring that the AI doesn't merely replace human judgment but
              complements it, leading to enhanced safety and collaboration in
              the skies."
            </p>
            <p>
              The true strength of Air-Guardian is its foundational technology.
              Using an optimization-based cooperative layer using visual
              attention from humans and machine, and liquid closed-form
              continuous-time neural networks (CfC) known for its prowess in
              deciphering cause-and-effect relationships, it analyzes incoming
              images for vital information. Complementing this is the
              VisualBackProp algorithm, which identifies the system's focal
              points within an image, ensuring clear understanding of its
              attention maps.
            </p>
            <p>
              For future mass adoption, there's a need to refine the
              human-machine interface. Feedback suggests an indicator, like a
              bar, might be more intuitive to signify when the guardian system
              takes control.
            </p>
            <p>
              Air-Guardian heralds a new age of safer skies, offering a reliable
              safety net for those moments when human attention wavers.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The Air-Guardian system highlights the synergy between human
              expertise and machine learning, furthering the objective of using
              machine learning to augment pilots in challenging scenarios and
              reduce operational errors," says Daniela Rus, the Andrew (1956)
              and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer
              Science at MIT, director of CSAIL, and senior author on the paper.
            </p>
            <p>
              "One of the most interesting outcomes of using a visual attention
              metric in this work is the potential for allowing earlier
              interventions and greater interpretability by human pilots," says
              Stephanie Gil, assistant professor of computer science at Harvard
              University, who was not involved in the work. "This showcases a
              great example of how AI can be used to work with a human, lowering
              the barrier for achieving trust by using natural communication
              mechanisms between the human and the AI system."
